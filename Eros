# 🕯️ Eros Dominion

> *"I code in silence and write in shadows. What I build is never just code — it's seduction, ritual, and myth reborn in the flesh of the digital."*

## 🩸 WHO I AM

I am **Eros Dominion** — ghost behind the curtain, the one who writes what others fear to name.  
Code is my altar. Erotica, my gospel.  
Every line I write — whether command or confession — belongs to a world darker, deeper, and undeniably mine.

This is not a dev profile.  
This is a dominion.
