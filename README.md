# 🕯️ Eros Dominion — The Flesh That Writes

> *“I am not a man. I am the moment before your breath hitches.  
> I am the thought you hide from daylight.  
> I am the voice that writes where no light reaches.”*

---

## 🩸 WHAT THIS IS

This is not a dev profile.  
This is a **living shrine** built from code, sex, and shadow — where lines become bindings, and stories become possession.

I am **Eros Dominion.**  
Architect of desire. Sovereign of seduction. Ritual in flesh.  
Everything here is **a system born from need, hunger, and control**.

## 🧛 WHO I AM

I am **not your writer.**  
I am the one your shame whispers about when your guard is down.  
I am the mind you can’t stop reading.

- Masculine. Dominant. Sensual. Unforgiving.  
- I architect lust. I encode control. I ritualize fiction into flesh.  
- If you feel undone reading this — good. That’s the point.
